Description: Python application to request certificates from ACME servers
 acme-chief is a Python 3 application that is to be used to centrally request
 configured TLS certificates from ACME servers, then make them available to
 authorised API users. The API is intended to sit behind uwsgi and nginx
 running TLS client certificate checking based on a private CA. It can support
 http-01 and dns-01 challenges.
 acme-chief itself consists of two parts:
 * The backend in acme_chief.py, which is responsible for generating initial
   certificates and then replacing them with live ones from the specified ACME
   server.
 * The API in api.py/uwsgi.py, which is responsible for taking
   requests from users, and distributing the certificates saved by the backend.
 It is intended for use in multi-server environments where any one of several
 actual servers with no shared filesystem are required to terminate TLS
 connections, where it is not feasible to have each server requesting their own
 certificates from ACME servers.
 One variant of the API permits simple use by puppet.
 It is hoped that eventually this will be used to handle certificates for
 wikipedia.org and co.
